Monitor/Debugger and BASIC for Bernd Ulmann's z80_mini (http://www.vaxman.de/projects/Z80_mini/index.html)
<p>
Binary files are minimon.rom (Monitor/Debugger) and minimonbas.rom (Monitor/Debugger and BASIC).
<p>
This version of software has been built for the Z80_mini Rev B board. It uses interrupts to signal when incoming characters are available. Interrupts may not work with the original Z80_mini board.
<p>
The software also changes the baud rate generator to assume a 7.3728MHz UART crystal and to achieve 115200 baudrate.
